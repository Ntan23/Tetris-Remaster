# Tetro

Tetro is a thrilling puzzle game that combines elements of Tetris and platforming. Players control a single block, maneuvering it to avoid falling tetrominoes and climb to new levels. The goal is to achieve the highest high score while navigating through increasingly challenging levels.

The game features a unique gameplay mechanic where players must strategically position their block to climb up to the next level. As players successfully reach a new level, the blocks below collapse, and the tetrominoes fall faster, adding to the intensity and challenge of the game.

The development process of Tetro has been challenging, with the team of talented designers, programmers, and artists working remotely to create a polished and engaging game in just 7 days for a game jam. Despite the challenges, the team has successfully created a unique and addictive puzzle game that offers an unforgettable gameplay experience.
